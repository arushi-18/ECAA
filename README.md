## General Information
E-commerce is an emerging and fast growing technique which is used to buy and sell categorized products or services, chat, transact, generate reports and track history of every customer. This project is about the design and development of an E-commerce mobile application.
The E-Commerce Android Application will allow any user to create an account to become a customer. The application will allow customers to browse, search, select, and add products to a shopping cart. Then, provided they have products in their shopping cart, check out products in the shopping cart and decrement the stock that the inventory system maintains. The ECAA also allows a manager to manage the inventory with full create, retrieve, update and delete (CRUD) functionality with regard to products in the system. The system will provide the customer with a receipt and it will log the transaction details.
